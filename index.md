</p>

Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at Federal
University of Pernambuco (Recife, PE - Brazil) advised by [Prof. Dr. Marcelo
d'Amorim](http://www.cin.ufpe.br/~damorim/). My goal is on finding,
diagnosing, repair, and preventing software bugs and vulnerabilities.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Federal University of
Campina Grande (Campina Grande, PB - Brazil) in 2015. As an undergraduate
student, I was awarded with a full scholarship from the Brazilian Government to
study at Walsh University (North Canton, OH - USA).

Past experiences include a [Google Summer of
Code](https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2014/orgs/eclipse/projects/jeandersonbc.html)
participation with the [Eclipse
Foundation](https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/platform-ui/) and a research
internship at University of Massachusetts (Amherst, MA - USA).
