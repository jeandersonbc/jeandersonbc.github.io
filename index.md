Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at Federal
University of Pernambuco (Recife, PE - Brazil) advised by Prof. Dr. Marcelo
d'Amorim. My goal is on finding, diagnosing, repair, and preventing software
bugs and vulnerabilities.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Federal University of
Campina Grande (Campina Grande, PB - Brazil) in 2015. As an undergraduate
student, I was awarded with a full scholarship from the Brazilian Government to
study at Walsh University (North Canton, OH - USA).

Past experiences include a Google Summer of Code participation with the Eclipse
Foundation and a research internship at University of Massachusetts (Amherst,
MA - USA).
