Hi all! This is the first post of my blog. Obviously, as a good programmer everything has to start with a Hello World. 
I'm excited for starting this blog because I've always wanted to write about what I love to do: Programming! I love programming and everything related to Computer Science in general. Then, be prepared to read about programming languages, mobile development, internet, technology, software development, and many other things. Fortunately, my website will be supporting syntax highlight:

{% highlight java %}
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello world");
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

I don't have much time to write but I will try to keep this blog updated as much as possible. There's always a little extra time to share something :)

I hope you have fun learning new things here as much as I will. I believe that interaction is the key for learning. Unfortunately, the only way to interact with me is through e-mail by this moment. However, I will be implementing some nice features here for comments and social networks.
Finally, this website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)! Don't forget to check it out ;)


See you next time!
