    <p>
      Software Engineer from Brazil based in the Netherlands. I'm interested in Distributed Systems, Development
      Productivity, Machine Learning for Software Engineering (ML4SE), and Program Analysis in general.
    </p>

    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>
      I'm a lifelong learner passionate about Software Engineering, Data, and Education.
    </p>

    <p>
      I received my Master's degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Pernambuco (Brazil) in 2018. In
      my
      thesis, I studied the challenges, benefits, and adoption of test suite parallelization in the Java open-source
      ecosystem. In addition to that, I also contributed to a project aimed at the detection of plugin interaction bugs
      in
      the WordPress PHP ecosystem. On that project, my supervisor and I proposed the initial version of a randomized
      divide-and-conquer algorithm to handle the combinatorial problem of detecting pairs of malfunctioning plugins in a
      large search space. That project was carried on by another student as I was close to graduation.
    </p>

    <p>
      From 2018 to 2021, I was a PhD candidate at the Software Engineer Research Group from Delft University of
      Technology
      (Netherlands) in partnership with Adyen, a Dutch fintech company. I was involved mainly in studing logging
      practices
      in an enterprise system. During that time, I published a summary of the broad landscape of observability, covering
      the latest developments in Academia and Industry on logging, processing (including ingestion and efficient
      storage),
      and analysis. I also conducted an exploratory study on the feasibility of learning logging patterns from source
      code
      so developers could make more informed decisions during development.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2021, I made the though decision of quitting academia to become a full-time Software Engineer with an
      unfinished degree. I was fortunate to be supervised by highly skilled experts in their fields. I fulfilled my goal
      of conducting my own projects, publishing, and presenting them at top-tier venues in Software Engineering during
      my time as a researcher.
      My passion for Software Engineering as a discipline remains but no longer in a "paper-publishing" oriented
      way. I'm driven by the challenges of developing and operating complex systems, and keeping engineering teams
      productive when handling large and complex code bases.
