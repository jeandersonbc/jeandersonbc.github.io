  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>I am currently an undergraduate student (senior) in Computer Science at
  <a target="new" href="https://computacao.ufcg.edu.br">Federal University of Campina Grande</a> (UFCG), Brazil. I lived abroad in the
  United States for 1 year and 2 months sponsored by the Brazilian Government. Since my freshman year (second semester), I have been
  involved in researches related to software engineer. Nowadays, I am associated with the <a target="new" href="http://dsc.ufcg.edu.br/~spg">
  Software Productivity Group</a>. I am studying how to make refactorings safer and how to make automated refactoring
  tools more practical for developers. When I am not studying, I like to spend some time solving programming
  problems and taking Computer Science classes online.</p>
