My personal website


Not just another average static html page: this is my frontend playground :metal: (which occasionally I use as my website).
My goal here is to keep updated with frontend frameworks and get my hands dirty.
For a sufficiently large project, I recommend using [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) to scaffold your client-side project
(unless you have really good reasons to do it yourself) or [JHipster](https://jhipster.github.io/) to quickly kickoff a
Sprint Boot + Angular project.

I currently have support to:

1. Automated build with `Gulp`
   - Resources optimization (minification and concatenation)
2. Package management with `npm` for `Gulp` plugins
3. Package management with `Bower` for the webapp
